Q- What property is used to add space around elements?

=> margin
The margin property in CSS is used to create space around elements, outside of any defined borders.


Q - What is the expected JavaScript output?

var add = (function ( ) {
  var counter = 0;
  return function ( ) {
       counter += 1; 
       return counter;
}
})();    
console.log(add());
console.log(add());
console.log(add());

=> 1, 2, 3
Hint : Self Invoking Functions are used Explanation: 
The function that IIFE is returning contains the lexical context of the IIFE, and it's stored in ‘add’. 
It gets invoked 3 times, and each time the counter is updated in the same lexical context.
