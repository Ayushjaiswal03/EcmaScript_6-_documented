How do you create a function in JavaScript?

=> function myFunction() {}
In JavaScript, you create a function using the function keyword, followed by the function name and parentheses. The code inside the curly braces is the function's body.



Consider following JavaScript code snippet -

var student = {
    firstName: "jonathan",
    lastName: "doe"
}

delete student.firstName;
console.log(student.firstName+ " "+ student.lastName);
What is the expected output?

=> undefined doe



Q. Predict the output of following JavaScript code

  state={
     value:1
  }
  componentDidMount() {
     console.log("Mounted")
     this.setState({value:2})  
  }
  render() {
     console.log("Rendered")
     return (
        <div>
          Hi
        <div/>
     )
  }

  => Rendered Mounted Rendered
Initial Render

render() runs first to paint the UI.

componentDidMount()

Called after the first render.

Safe place to trigger side effects like setState().

State Change Triggers Re-render

setState() updates the state.

React schedules a re-render.

render() runs again with the new state.

Problem statement
Guess the output of the following JavaScript code :



class Base {

   show() {
      console.log("Base class show() method called");
  }

}

class Derived extends Base {

   show() {
      console.log("Derived class show() method called");
}

}

let b = new Derived();
b.show();

=> Derived class show() method called
