How do you create a function in JavaScript?

=> function myFunction() {}
In JavaScript, you create a function using the function keyword, followed by the function name and parentheses. The code inside the curly braces is the function's body.



Consider following JavaScript code snippet -

var student = {
    firstName: "jonathan",
    lastName: "doe"
}

delete student.firstName;
console.log(student.firstName+ " "+ student.lastName);
What is the expected output?

=> undefined doe
