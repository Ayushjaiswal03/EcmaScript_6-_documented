        <h1>Neural Networks: Forward and Backpropagation</h1>
        <p>
            Neural networks are a fundamental concept in machine learning, inspired by the structure and function of the human brain. They consist of layers of interconnected nodes, or neurons, that process and transmit information. The process of training a neural network involves two key phases: forward propagation and backpropagation.
