Which of these lines will give an error in HTML & CSS?

1- function foo(){
2-    a = 5;
3-    var b =10;
}
foo();
4- console.log(a);
5- console.log(b);

=> 5
In js, a variable is first declared and then it is initialized. 
The variable ‘a’ will be declared automatically and it will be hoisted to the top. 
All the variables that are undeclared are global variables. So, when we console.log(a) there will be no error. 
However, variable b is inside the scope of the function foo and calling it outside the function will give a ‘Reference Error’.
