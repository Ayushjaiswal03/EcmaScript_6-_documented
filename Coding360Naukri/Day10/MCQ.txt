Q- Choose the correct output for the following JavaScript code

var a = 1 ; 
if(a==true){
    console.log("Hey") ;
}else{
    console.log("Bye") ;
}

=> Hey
üîç What‚Äôs Happening?
a == true uses loose equality (==), which allows type coercion.

JavaScript tries to convert a and true to comparable types.

‚úÖ Type Coercion Logic
true becomes 1 when coerced to a number.

So a == true becomes 1 == 1, which is true.




Q- If the below two properties are applied on a flex item -

width: 500px;
flex-basis: 250px;


What will be its width?
=> 250px
The "width" property gets overridden by "flex-basis" property. 
So, "flex-basis: 250px;" gets applied and the width of the element becomes "250px".

Why?
In a flex container, flex-basis overrides width as the starting point for layout calculations.

So even though width: 500px is declared, the browser uses flex-basis: 250px to size the item initially.

üîç Exceptions
If flex-basis is set to auto, then width is used.

If the item has flex-grow or flex-shrink, the final width may change based on available space.
