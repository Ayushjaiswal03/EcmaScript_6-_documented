Q- Choose the correct output for the following JavaScript code

var a = 1 ; 
if(a==true){
    console.log("Hey") ;
}else{
    console.log("Bye") ;
}

=> Hey
🔍 What’s Happening?
a == true uses loose equality (==), which allows type coercion.

JavaScript tries to convert a and true to comparable types.

✅ Type Coercion Logic
true becomes 1 when coerced to a number.

So a == true becomes 1 == 1, which is true.
