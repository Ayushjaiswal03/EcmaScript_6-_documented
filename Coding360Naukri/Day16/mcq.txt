Q-  What will be the output of the JavaScript code below?

function Abc() {
"use strict"
this.a = 25;
return {a: 35, b: 44};
}
var obj = new Abc();
console.log(obj.a, obj.b);

=> 35 44
The statement ‘ new Abc(); ’ will make a new object of ‘Abc’ and call the constructor of ‘Abc’, then in the constructor the statement ‘ return {a: 35, b: 44}; ’will return a new object which would get stored in var obj. Thus on printing obj.a and obj.b will print 35 and 44.
